- add forms to table
    - use forms with buttons? (like in bootstrap template https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/checkout/)
- ~~add header and footer to rest of pages~~
- ~~fix navbar covering heading~~
- ~~see if edit and delete buttons can become more 'resizeable~~
- ~~fix navbar elements disappearing for "mobile" page width~~ - left impressum only
- ~~fix overall formatting of html files for better readability~~

- transfer these as todos on the webpage?
